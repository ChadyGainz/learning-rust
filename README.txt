chady !!! thats me. hi :3

at the time of writing this, im currently learning the rust programming language. i'm following the rust book (https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/title-page.html) 
but also adding my own silly little twist on some of the exercises. if you want to do this stuff too, just check out the book! rust is open source !!

the lack of a license means you can't use my code or whatever whatever. you know all the legal stuff. the code is mostly from the rust book
anyways, just with some alterations for my own educational purposes. i don't care too much about this project, to be honest; i'm just preparing
good organizational habits ahead of time so developing actual stuff isn't hell :3

i probably won't update this readme at all, i'm just rambling about this project at the very start because i feel like it. once i finish learning
all the stuff i need to, i'll develop real projects that have purposes, so stay tuned, i suppose!

and hey. along the way, maybe you'll learn something too! who knows?
